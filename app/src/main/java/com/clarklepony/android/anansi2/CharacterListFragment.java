    /*
    RecyclerViews do not create ViewHolders for themselves. Instead, they ask an adapter.
    An adapter is a controller object that sits between the RecyclerView and the data set
    that the RecyclerView should display. It's responsible for:

    1:Creating the necessary ViewHolders, and
    2:Binding ViewHolders to data from the model layer

    To build an adapter, we first define a subclass of RecyclerView.Adapter. Our adapter
    subclass will wrap the list of actors we get from ActorManager.

    When the RecyclerView needs a view object to display, it will have a conversation with
    its adapter. First, RecyclerView asks how many objects are in the list by calling the
    adapter's getItemCount(). method. Then the RecyclerView calls the adapter's
    OnCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup, int) method to create a new ViewHolder, which contains a
    view to display.
